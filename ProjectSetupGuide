Install Java 8 

*** Java 8 and higher version doesn't match well with the version of Scala 2.12 and upgrading Scala version is a pain

*** You can export $JAVA_HOME="/Library/***/java1.8.sdk/contents/Home"

*** Don't forget to update the bash profile file

*** Make sure to double check the java -version

Install sbt 0.13 version

*** use brew install sbt@0.13 to get sbt

*** check version with command sbt sbtVersion

*** then go into the project folder and run sbt clean

*** sbt reload

*** sbt compile

*** sbt "run 7000" it must be 7000 due to security filters setup in the application config file
